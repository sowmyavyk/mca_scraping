# CIN Data Scraper

## Overview
This repository contains a Python application to scrape director details from the MCA website using Selenium and Tkinter. The application allows users to select an Excel file with CINs, and it will generate an output Excel file with the scraped data.

## Files

- **`main.ipynb`**: Main Jupyter Notebook to run the Tkinter application for scraping.
- **`script.py`**: Test script for the core scraping functionality.
- **`import.py`**: Test script for module imports and setup.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the required Python packages for the project.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sowmyavyk/mca_scraping.git
   cd mca_scraping
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Backup Files:** Ensure you have backups of any other scripts or important files. You may need them if running the code in different environments.

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells to start the Tkinter GUI for scraping.

2. **Input File:**
   - The input Excel file should contain a column named `CIN` with the CINs to be processed.

3. **Output File:**
   - The application will generate an output Excel file with the scraped director details in the specified output folder.

## Known Issues

- Ensure that your environment has the required permissions and network access for web scraping.
- If encountering CAPTCHA issues, the application will attempt to solve them using the configured method.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with Tkinter or Selenium, verify that all dependencies are correctly installed and configured.
- For any errors or issues, refer to the console logs or error messages for guidance.
